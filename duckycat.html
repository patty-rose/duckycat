  <h2>origin of Ducky cat</h2>
  <p>Duckycat came into my life in 2012 as a pet left behind by a roomate. His meow sounded like a quack, so he became "Duck". And eventually everyone called him "Ducky cat". After promising my roomate I would find him a new home, and then failing, I realized I loved him and we were a family.</p>
